        <h1>Rules of JuggleFit</h1>
        <h2>Competition Format</h2>
        <h3>Routes</h3>
        <p>JuggleFit is built around "routes"—sequences of juggling tricks drawn from a list of general skills. A secret route is revealed just minutes before the competition begins. Competitors race to complete it, and the first to finish wins. If no one completes the route within 10 minutes, the winner is the one who progresses furthest the fastest.</p>
        <h3>Qualifications</h3>
        <p>Competitors must complete a secret list of tricks within 30 minutes. The tricks vary by route (e.g., balls, clubs, rings). Those who complete all 10 qualification tricks advance to the finals. If fewer than 7 qualify, the top performers (based on most tricks completed) fill the finals.</p>
        <h3>Categories & Non-Competitive Routes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Routes are divided by props: balls, clubs, and rings.</li>
            <li>Optional categories include Youth (under 16/18) and Women.</li>
            <li>Competitors can join multiple routes if eligible.</li>
            <li>Non-competitive route races are offered for fun and practice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Competition Logistics</h2>
        <p>To host a JuggleFit event, you’ll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Time slots for qualifications and finals.</li>
            <li>A speaker and microphone for finals announcements.</li>
            <li>Either a printing setup for trick forms or a big screen to display tricks during the finals.</li>
        </ul>
